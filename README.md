# Stochastic Calculus
Collection of scripts and simulations implementing some stochastic calculus concepts.

**Python 3.8**

### Sample paths
Sample paths from poisson process and brownian motion.

### Brownian bridge
Sample midpoints in a brownian bridge path.

### European option 
Calculate the expected return on a european option, modelling stock as a geometric brownian motion.

### Approximating Geometric Brownian Motion
By sampling discrete steps approximate geometric brownian motion, compare solution and rate of convergence with exact solution.
